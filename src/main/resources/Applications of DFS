Minimum Spanning Tree - For a weighted graph, DFS traversal of the graph produces the minimum spanning tree.

Detecting cycle in a graph - While performing DFS, we find back edges that are useful for detecting cycle in a graph.

Path Finding - We can specialize the DFS algorithm to find a path between two given vertices u and z.

Topological Sorting - 

Finding Strongly Connected Components of a graph - A directed graph is called strongly connected if there is a path from each vertex in the graph to every other vertex
